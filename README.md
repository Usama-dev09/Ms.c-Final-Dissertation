Research project exploring how AI-driven health app recommendations affect diet and physical activity among young adults in the US. Includes dataset analysis, ML models, and insights on personalization, engagement, ethics, and improving long-term digital health outcomes.
# AI-Driven Health App Recommendation Analysis

This repository contains the code, data references, and supporting materials for a thesis project analyzing how data- and AI-driven recommendation features in health applications influence diet and physical activity behaviors among young adults in the United States.

The study relies on secondary, publicly available datasets and applies machine learning and statistical techniques to examine user engagement, adherence, and long-term behavior trends.
